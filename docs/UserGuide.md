## Features

### Foreword
All commands have a standard format so that you can easily remember them. A typical command will take the form:

> `<Command> <Fields>`

The following segments will list and explain the various commands. The structure of the commands will be explained in this form:

> `<Command> <Required fields> [<Optional fields>]`

Words within the angle brackets "<" and ">" are meant for you to fill according to what is required.  

> `add Meeting with boss` 

For instance, in the example above, "<Task Name>" will refer to "Meeting with boss" when you are trying to add a meeting to your schedule. Note the lack of the angle brackets when you are typing "Meeting with boss".

Words not within angle brackets are keywords, and should be typed as they appear. For instance, if you see see the format "add <Task Name> .on <Date>", you can type `add Meeting with boss .on Wednesday`.

Words within the square brackets "[" and "]" are optional fields. You can choose to include these fields when typing the commands, but it is fully optional.
